The program is divided into four modules:
1.) file_parser : This file contains functions to parse the given makefile and decide the type of each line.
2.) build_spec_repr: This file contains to create structure for target, list of target, etc.
3.) build_spec_graph: This file contains functions to create a graph from targets, detect cycle in graph and execute build a specific target.
4.) execute_command: This file contains function to execute a given command using fork-exec.

Working of the program:
1.) The program will first parse the given makefile to create a list of targets.
2.) Then the program will create a graph using the list of targets and their dependencies.
3.) Next, it will check if the graph has any cyclic dependencies.
4.) Lastly, it will build the make recipie for given target (or the first target in the makefile if none is provided).

Program usage: ./537make [-f <filename>] [target]
